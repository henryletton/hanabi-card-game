# Hanabi Card Game

[Hanabi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanabi_(card_game)) is a cooperative card game where players are aware of other players' cards but not their own, and attempt to play a series of cards in a specific order to set off a simulated fireworks show. The types of information that players may give to each other is limited, as is the total amount of information that can be given during the game.  


This project aims to aims to reproduce the rules and gameplay in order to run simulations to optimise so called player "conventions" (or strategies).
